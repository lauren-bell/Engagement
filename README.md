Engagement With a Behavior Change App for Alcohol Reduction: Data Visualization for Longitudinal Observational Study

Set A was measured from May 17, 2017, to January 22, 2019 (615 days), including date of download and time stamps of all use. This period was chosen as it reflects a time in which the content of the app was relatively stable.

Set B included all users whose use was measured in Set A, with data only over the first 30 days from download, with the measure “Did use occur on this day?” (binary, yes or no) for each user.
