Engagement With a Behavior Change App for Alcohol Reduction: Data Visualization for Longitudinal Observational Study


Data set 1 included 19,233 users who downloaded Drink Less between May 17, 2017, and January 22, 2019 (615 days). The inclusion criteria for users included having a baseline AUDIT score of 8 or above, which is indicative of excessive drinking [39]; being from the United Kingdom; being aged 18 years or above; being interested in reducing their alcohol consumption; using app versions 1.0.11 to 1.0.16; and having consented to the Privacy Notice (

Multimedia Appendix 1). Screen views data are recorded automatically and downloaded via Panda scripts from Nodechef (a web-based platform for hosting mobile apps) using a secure https protocol. Sessions were derived from screen views using the Pandas script.

Users who downloaded the app on August 21, 2018 (n=5830), were excluded as an article on BBC News was published on this date, which endorsed the app (Garnett et al, unpublished data, 2020); thus, these users were likely to have different characteristics and engagement behavior.

Data set 2 included time stamps of 829,001 sessions and 8,169,005 screen views of the 19,233 users in data set 1. This includes 122,332 entries of alcohol-free days and 123,704 entries of alcohol drinks consumed. All use was recorded from May 17, 2017, to April 16, 2019 (699 days). As such, users had a minimum of 84 days of use measured.

To explore various engagement aspects, we developed sets of data from data sets 1 and 2 with varying engagement measures.

Set A
All use was measured from May 17, 2017, to January 22, 2019 (615 days), including date of download and time stamps of all use. This period was chosen as it reflects a time in which the content of the app was relatively stable.

Set B
Set B included all users whose use was measured in Set A, with data only over the first 30 days from download, with the measure “Did use occur on this day?” (binary, yes or no) for each user.
